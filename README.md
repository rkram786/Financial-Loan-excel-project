 BANK LOANDOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial decisions.
Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes, including:
Loan Applications: When individuals or businesses apply for loans, they submit detailed applications that include personal and financial information. This data is collected electronically or in paper form.
Credit Reports: Banks often access credit reports from credit bureaus when assessing a borrower's creditworthiness. These reports contain information about a person's credit history, existing loans, and payment behaviour.
Internal Records: Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, including disbursements, repayments, and loan status changes. These records are generated and stored in the bank's database.
Online Portals: Many banks offer online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans, make payments, and access account information. Data from these portals is collected and stored for analysis.
Third-party Data Sources: Some banks may use external data sources, such as income verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers.

Process of Granting a Loan
Loan Application:
The process begins when a customer submits a loan application to a bank or lending institution. This application can be submitted in person, online, or through other channels.
Application Review:
The lending institution reviews the loan application and collects necessary documentation, such as income statements, credit reports, and identification documents.
